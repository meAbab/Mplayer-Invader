# Mplayer-Invader
I need to work in a project for my Advance JavaScript course to build a multiplayer online game.
The game is based on Phaser engine and extension of Phaser Invader example. I also added WebRTC so player can make audio
conference among them (also has option that player can allow or deny somebody's conference request).

Here are the scattered files of that project, I'm searching the final presentaion one. Once found will update here.
